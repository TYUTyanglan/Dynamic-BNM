# Dynamic-BNM
Dynamic Brain Network Model(Dynamic BNM) is a MATLAB toolbox for the simulation of the dynamics of large-scale brain networks,which parameters are determined by the range of actual physiological value.In this toolbox,brain structure connection, distance matrix and basic parameter information of dynamic model can be defined as input containing fundamental information about brain networks.Through the constructed brain network dynamics model, the brain nerve activity similar to the real observation is simulated. 
Dynamic BNM can directly use the dynamic model simulation without deep understanding of the dynamic model principle.There are two dynamic models, one is the Kuramoto model of coupled phase oscillators with time delays , and the other is the Reduced Wongwang model of the excitatory and inhibitory interaction of spike neurons.In addition, the toolbox can also simulate more realistic time series by automatically adjusting parameters, without manual operation in the intermediate process.
